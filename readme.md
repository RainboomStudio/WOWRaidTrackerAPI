# World Of Warcraft Raid Tracker
Here at Rainboom Studio, we love playing [World Of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/) !  
But we need some tools to track what raid we played and when, so we made it.  
You are on the API part. [The Web part](https://github.com/RainboomStudio/WOWRaidTrackerWeb) is also made with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

This is a work in progress.
